Styling is assisted by [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Unit testing is run with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), end-to-end testing with [Testcaf√©](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe). The linting tool is [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/), and the code formatting tool is [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

This project uses dotenv, so make a .env file in base directory with the following:

```
TYPEORM_CONNECTION = mysql
TYPEORM_HOST = localhost
TYPEORM_USERNAME = forumuser123
TYPEORM_PASSWORD = forumpass123
TYPEORM_DATABASE = forumdb
TYPEORM_PORT = 3306
TYPEORM_SYNCHRONIZE = false
TYPEORM_LOGGING = false
TYPEORM_ENTITIES = src/db/entities/*.ts
```

...with values changed as seen fit.
